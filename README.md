# EscapeRoomGame
This was a school project that was utilizing the VR prompts that were available in Unity. I had 1 month time and was testing my capabilities on creating a puzzle VR
game. It was my second time now working with Unity VR and even though it is a small game, it was fun to make.
This project will not receive any updates.
